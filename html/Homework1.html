                    A beginner can learn English in a year. Thatâ€™s pretty fast, although not as fast as some of the
                    crazy 15-day promises
                    you see online. Specifically, a year is the average amount of time it will take an adult to become
                    fluent enough to work
                    in English if he starts out as a beginner and studies at least 5 hours a day. But everyone is
                    different.

                        No, it's going to take more than just 3 months of learning to get a web dev job. You'll need to
                        get some real experience
                        first. I suggest starting by building a portfolio site for yourself. Then do at least 3 free
                        projects for friends/family
                        or some local small business.
